# Random Scale Picker

Fun project I made after school.

It generates scales that I need to practice for my french horn rcm test lol.

## Run locally

You can just open the `index.html` file because the elm code is already compiled to javascript lol, but if you want to change it a few more steps is needed.

Make sure you have `elm`, and `elm-live` installed (I used `elm-live` to make this)

Run `elm-live src/Main.elm --open -- --output=elm.js` in the root folder in the terminal to run the app in a localhost.
